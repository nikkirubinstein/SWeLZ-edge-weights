# SWeLZ-edge-weights

This repository contains .txt files describing the egde weights used for the SWeLZ (Spatially Weighted Likelihoods in ZEST) perimetric algorithm. Files are written in space-separated format, with row and column headers giving the position of each location in (x,y) degrees of visual angle from fixation. For further details on the algorithm, see the published paper: [Rubinstein, N. J., McKendrick, A. M., & Turpin, A. (2016). Incorporating Spatial Models in Visual Field Test Procedures.
